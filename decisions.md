# Postify Decisions

## 2026-08-28 — Reposition away from generic blogging
**Decision:** Postify will target practical knowledge for builders, not compete head-on as a general-purpose Medium clone.

**Why:** Established platforms already have strong network effects, monetization, discovery, newsletters, or technical-blog ownership. Replicating their feature lists does not create a reason to switch.

## 2026-08-28 — Frontend-first validation before Supabase redesign
**Decision:** New content types and trust/utility presentation are introduced with graceful client-side derivation first. Supabase schema work is postponed.

**Why:** The product model should be validated before database migrations and auth/content-policy work create switching cost.

## 2026-08-28 — Quiet utility over decorative trend UI
**Decision:** Remove marquee/glow-heavy presentation from the core reading/discovery path. Use restrained surfaces, strong typography, clear metadata and one accent color.

## 2026-08-28 — “Last edited/reviewed” instead of “verified” by default
**Decision:** We will not display “verified” unless a future workflow provides evidence. Existing dates can support neutral freshness language only.
