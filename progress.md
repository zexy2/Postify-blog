# Postify Progress

## 2026-08-28 — Product value MVP implemented locally
Completed:
- Audited repository structure, homepage, article, navigation, fallback content, and build setup.
- Chose a practical-knowledge positioning instead of a generic Medium-style blog proposition.
- Created persistent project memory: context, requirements, decisions, backlog, known issues, reports, and specs.
- Reworked the homepage value proposition around usable knowledge: guides, decision notes, explainers, and field notes.
- Replaced the glow-heavy primary feed with a calmer utility-oriented lead + list layout.
- Added frontend-only content-type derivation so existing Supabase rows do not require a schema migration yet.
- Added neutral freshness/date presentation without fake “verified” claims.
- Added an article “before you read” panel showing expected outcome, content type, reading time, and relevant date.
- Simplified the header/navigation and preserved search, auth, bookmarks, language, theme, profile/admin routes.
- Preserved fallback-content behavior and Turkish/English support.

Verification:
- `npm ci`: PASS in `node:20-alpine` Docker.
- `npm run lint`: PASS with 0 errors and the same 1 pre-existing React Hooks warning in `src/components/ui/design-testimonial.jsx`.
- `npm run build`: PASS.
- No Supabase schema or production deployment changes were made.

Current branch:
- `chatgpt/postify-rethink` on the Oracle development clone `/opt/postify-dev`.

Next:
- Preview the product-value MVP in a browser and fix visual/interaction issues found there.
- Then implement author-side structured templates (Guide / Decision / Explainer / Field Note) without requiring Supabase schema changes yet.

## Overnight loop checkpoint — 04:15 TRT
- Production deployment is now explicitly permitted after quality gates pass.
- Continuing autonomous product-development loops on `chatgpt/postify-rethink`.


## 2026-08-28 — Controlled loop batch (7+ loops)
Completed in this run:
1. Restored the documented test command and added focused tests for Postify content presentation.
2. Removed the remaining React Hooks lint warning; lint now passes with zero warnings/errors.
3. Added four author writing modes (Guide / Decision note / Explainer / Field note) with localized, actionable writing briefs and no database dependency.
4. Added safe local draft autosave/restore with user+language scoped keys and tests.
5. Added reader-side format filtering so discovery can be driven by intended outcome, not only category/search.
6. Hardened SEO/PWA identity: Postify naming, practical-knowledge description, canonical URL normalization, Article structured data, correct app icon metadata, Turkish static document language.
7. Added a repeatable release gate (`npm run verify`) plus build artifact smoke checks and a runtime Vite preview smoke for `/` and an article SPA route.
8. Updated README to reflect the new product positioning and release workflow.

Evidence:
- `npm test`: 10 test files / 42 tests PASS.
- `npm run lint`: PASS, zero warnings/errors.
- `npm run build`: PASS.
- `npm run smoke:build`: PASS.
- Runtime preview smoke: `/` HTTP 200 and `/posts/ai-muhendisligi` HTTP 200.
- `git diff --check`: PASS.

Production status:
- Quality gates are green. Deployment via the current GitHub Pages path will be attempted after checkpoint commit.


### Follow-up loop — language accessibility + deploy attempt
- Added dynamic `<html lang>` synchronization when the user switches Turkish/English.
- Re-ran `npm run verify`: 10 test files / 42 tests PASS, lint clean, production build PASS, build smoke PASS.
- Attempted the repository's existing GitHub Pages deploy path after gates were green.
- First deploy attempt exposed Docker git safe-directory context; strategy was corrected.
- Second deploy reached GitHub but failed because the Oracle workspace has no GitHub HTTPS write credential (`could not read Username for https://github.com`).
- Connected GitHub integration also returned HTTP 403 when creating a branch, confirming there is no usable repository write path from this run.
- Production was left untouched and remains healthy: `https://postify.zekiakgul.dev/` returned HTTP 200 and still serves the prior `Postify Blog` build.
- No DNS/hosting architecture switch was attempted as a workaround; preserving the healthy production site is safer than rerouting hosting solely to bypass missing GitHub credentials.


## 2026-08-28 — Controlled loop batch: author quality + reader utility
Completed in this run:
1. Added a publish-readiness panel that separates required title/body checks from advisory scannable-structure guidance.
2. Added live author metrics for word count and estimated reading time.
3. Added safe one-click starter outlines for Guide / Decision note / Explainer / Field note; outlines add structure only and never fabricate article content.
4. Added deterministic article heading anchors and an automatic “On this page / Bu yazıda” outline when enough headings exist.
5. Added a transparent external-reference section that only surfaces URLs actually present in article content; same-origin links are excluded.
6. Added keyboard skip navigation, global focus-visible treatment, and accessible loading status semantics.
7. Added a ≤5-minute quick-read discovery filter alongside content-format filters.

Verification evidence:
- Focused tests for publish readiness, writing metrics, writing templates, and article structure: PASS.
- Full `npm run verify`: 13 test files / 52 tests PASS, lint PASS with zero warnings/errors, production build PASS, build smoke PASS.
- Runtime Vite preview smoke: `/`, `/posts/ai-muhendisligi`, `/posts/create` all HTTP 200; product HTML metadata check PASS.
- `git diff --check`: PASS.

Release note:
- GitHub write access has since been restored through the connected GitHub integration. This batch is eligible for branch push/PR/CI and production release after the checkpoint commit.

## 2026-08-28 — Controlled loop batch: resilient drafts + shareable discovery
Completed in this run:
1. Fixed restored drafts so their selected writing mode is restored with the content.
2. Made content-format discovery state URL-addressable via the `type` query parameter.
3. Made quick-read discovery state URL-addressable via the `reading=quick` query parameter.
4. Preserved category/type/reading filters when any one filter changes instead of overwriting sibling query state.
5. Reset feed pagination when category changes and added explicit group semantics to format/time filters.
6. Made quick-read filtering derive reading time from body/excerpt when API metadata is absent, while excluding posts with no measurable text; added unit coverage.
7. Connected title validation and character-count feedback to the title input with `aria-invalid`, `aria-describedby`, and alert semantics.

Verification: focused post-presentation/draft tests pass (10/10); full `npm run verify` passes with 13 test files / 53 tests, lint clean, production build PASS, and build smoke PASS. Runtime preview smoke returned HTTP 200 for `/`, the combined filter URL, and `/posts/create`; HTML product marker PASS.

Production check after the batch: root returned HTTP 200 and serves the newer Postify identity, but a direct article deep link returned HTTP 404. Therefore this run does not claim a successful production deploy; deep-link hosting fallback is recorded as a release issue.

## 2026-08-28 — Final release validation
- Re-ran the full release gate after the overnight batches: 13 test files / 53 tests PASS, lint clean, production build PASS, build smoke PASS.
- Hardened the GitHub Pages SPA fallback release gate: `docs/404.html` is now a required build artifact and its redirect/product identity are verified.
- Updated the fallback page from the stale “Postify Blog” identity to “Postify — Uygulanabilir Bilgi”.
- Production root remains healthy; direct article requests currently return GitHub Pages HTTP 404 before client-side fallback, so release verification must distinguish HTTP status from browser redirect behavior.
